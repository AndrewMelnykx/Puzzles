// Your answer touches on the basic concepts, but there's a bit more nuance to the distinction between state and props. Here's a breakdown to help clarify:

// State is data that is local to a component and can change over time. It's usually used to track values that may change as a result of user interaction (like form inputs) or other dynamic behavior within the component. State is owned and managed by the component itself.

// Example: Tracking the value of an input field locally within a form component.

// Props (short for properties) are how components receive data from their parent components. Props are read-only, meaning a component cannot modify the props it receives; it's just a way to pass data down the component tree.

// Example: A parent component might pass down user information (via props) to a child component that displays a user profile.

// Key Differences:
// State is mutable, meaning it can be changed by the component.
// Props are immutable from the perspective of the component receiving them.
// You can use state within a single component, while props allow you to share data across components.
// Your point about using state for local form input handling is correct! But when data needs to be shared between multiple components (e.g., large data or global state), you’re right—props or external storage like Redux is a better fit.

// Would you like an example to show the difference between state and props in a small React component?
